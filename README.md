You will need Git for this project, you might have to [install it](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/7kPsched1VMPOY2bdvZvGQ "install it") on your computer if it's not done yet.

-   Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine -- they will be part of your commits. [Tips](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/oAAqmPJ1ftZZhUjaw7FvjA "Tips")

On [GitHub.com](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/4vp5Qze3WATHKtytzT2_UA "GitHub.com"):

-   Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it's not done yet)
    -   Description: `This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer`
    -   Public repo: `zero_day`
    -   No `README`, `.gitignore`, or license

On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

-   Navigate to your home directory. [Tips](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/YeOwsN-vhfSCbNjgE01Gag "Tips")
-   Create a directory `zero_day`. [Tips](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/hWrqqlilEv8L6yqpyt1TTA "Tips")
-   Navigate to this new directory. [Tips](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/za58mq537U6U775osQ8bfQ "Tips")
-   Initialize git and add the remote origin
-   Create a file `README.md` with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small [Markdown](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/VV79mKOEf5mXVbKpH4i63Q "Markdown") text to present this project. **This file is mandatory in projects**
-   Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message "My first commit" and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)

Good job!

You pushed your first file in your **first repository** of the **first task** of your **first School project**.
